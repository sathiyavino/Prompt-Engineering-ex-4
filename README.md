# EXP 4 Scenario-Based Report Development Utilizing Diverse Prompting Techniques- Lab Scenario: Smart Health Assistant System
# Description: 
## Background:
You are part of a development team working on an AI-based Smart Health Assistant named "MediGuide" that assists elderly patients in managing chronic diseases like diabetes, hypertension, and arthritis. The assistant must provide tailored health advice, medication reminders, daily tips, and emotional support through natural language conversations.

## Objective:
Develop a scenario-based report that demonstrates how diverse prompting techniques (zero-shot, few-shot, chain-of-thought, role-based, and multi-modal prompts) can be used to optimize MediGuide’s responses in different use cases.

# Algorithm:



# output:
# Use Case 1: Arthritis - Daily Advice
# Zero-shot Prompt:
```
Provides basic, general advice.
Output: Generic exercise and diet tips.
```

# Few-shot Prompt:
```
Builds on previous advice for continuity and personalization.
Output: Personalized follow-up with gentle yoga and hydration tips.
```
# Role-based Prompt: 
```
Assigning a specific role (virtual physiotherapist) results in detailed guidance.
Output: Comprehensive morning routine with stretches, warm-ups, and breathing practices.
```
# Use Case 2: Hypertension - Monitoring and Alerts
# Chain-of-Thought Prompt: 
```
Encourages the AI to reason step-by-step, fostering an informative and educational response.
Output: Breaks down BP readings, explains potential risks, and recommends medical consultation.
```

# Few-shot Prompt: 
```
Tracks trends in blood pressure readings, providing context to fluctuations.
Output: Offers a clearer understanding of the readings and lifestyle changes (diet check).
```

# Use Case 3: Diabetes - Emotional Support
# Role-based Prompt:
```
Positioning the AI as a supportive companion allows for a nurturing, empathetic response.
Output: Provides motivational words and stress reduction strategies.
```

# Multi-modal Prompt: 
```
Combining images (sugar readings) with text enhances response by analyzing data and offering calming tips.
Output: Generates a comprehensive response with visual data analysis, along with voice-based guidance.
```
# conclusion:
The experiment illustrates how using advanced prompting techniques significantly boosts the relevance, personalization, and emotional intelligence of AI health assistants. The tailored responses are particularly beneficial for elderly patients managing chronic conditions. By applying these methods, MediGuide can be made more effective, offering not just clinical support but also empathetic, motivational assistance for users, increasing their trust and satisfaction with the system.
# Result:
The experiment successfully demonstrated how diverse prompting strategies significantly influence the relevance, personalization, and empathetic tone of MediGuide’s responses.
